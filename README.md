# Industrial Copper Modeling

Welcome to the **Industrial Copper Modeling** project! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to enhance decision-making in the copper industry by predicting selling prices and classifying lead statuses. Here’s a brief overview of the project experience, tools used, and the approach taken.

## Problem Statement
The copper industry data, often skewed and noisy, presents challenges for accurate manual predictions. This project aims to:
- Build a regression model to predict the continuous variable `Selling_Price`.
- Develop a classification model to predict the `Status` of leads (`WON` or `LOST`).
- Create a Streamlit application for user interaction with the models.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For scripting, data preprocessing, and machine learning.
- **Streamlit**: To build an interactive web application.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development and evaluation.

## Approach

### 1. Data Understanding
- Identify variable types (continuous, categorical) and distributions.
- Handle missing values and erroneous data in columns like `Material_Reference`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values with appropriate imputation methods.
- Treat outliers using techniques like IQR or Isolation Forest.
- Address skewness using transformations like log transformation or boxcox transformation.
- Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize outliers and skewness using boxplots, distplots, and violin plots.
- Use heatmaps to identify and drop highly correlated columns.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Create new features by transforming existing ones.
- Drop irrelevant or redundant features.

### 5. Model Building and Evaluation
#### Regression Model:
- Predict the continuous variable `Selling_Price`.
- Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

#### Classification Model:
- Predict the `Status` of leads (`WON` or `LOST`).
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.

### 6. Streamlit Application
- Build an interactive page for regression and classification tasks.
- Provide input fields for user data entry and display predicted outcomes.
- Ensure feature engineering steps are applied to user input for accurate predictions.

### 7. Deployment
- Deploy the Streamlit application for easy access and use by stakeholders.

## Learning Outcomes
- Proficiency in Python and data analysis libraries.
- Experience in data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization.
- Understanding of EDA techniques for data visualization.
- Skills in building and evaluating machine learning models for regression and classification.
- Experience in feature engineering and model optimization.
- Ability to create interactive web applications using Streamlit.
- Practical insights into solving real-world problems in the manufacturing domain using machine learning.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive experience in data analysis, machine learning modeling, and web application development, tailored to address challenges in the copper industry. By automating predictions and classifications, the project aims to optimize pricing decisions and lead management, enhancing overall business efficiency.
